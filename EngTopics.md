## Problem Solving
The major mistake that happined while solving problem is:<br />
- star coding 
- trying to solve it on the first iteration
### simple steps for solving the problem:
1. read the peoblem completely twice .
2. solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. optimize the manual steps.
4. write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. 
6. optimize the real code .
**As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.**

#### read the problem 
the most important step.<br />
**if you can explain the problem to someone else that mean you understand it .**<br />
#### solve it manually
**nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually**<br />

#### optimize the manual solution
this step will help you to rearrange and reconstruct and idea in your head than it is in code.<br />
**How**:<br />
by figuring out if there is another way to solve the problem easier or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.
#### write pseudo-code or comments
capturing all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments .
#### repace comments with real code 
if you struggle here there are two possible reasons:
- you didn't break down the problem into small enough steps.
l- you don't know you programming language well enough to do the conversion

## be prductive as you got 1000$/hour 
- dont wast your time on silly things 
- improve your skills, dont work just to let them take from your life.
- do not be busy. be focused
- People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable
## How to think like a programmer
the steps for solving problems like programmer <br />
1. Understand:
 write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it
2. Plan:**Don’t dive right into solving without a plan  Plan your solution!**
3. Divide:break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
4. Stuck?Don’t worry though,This happens to everyone! and follow these steps :<br />
    - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong
    - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
    - Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it
