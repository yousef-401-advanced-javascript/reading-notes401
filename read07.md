# Express
- Event driven system
  - **app.get('/thing', (req,res) => {})**
   - This is the same pattern we see in Vanilla JS, jQuery
   - ‘When a get event happens in our server, on “/thing”, run this function…’
-  the request object
   - `(req, ..)`
   - /:parameters 
     - `app.get('/api/:tjing', ...)` = `req.params.thing`  
   - query strings
     - `http://server/route?ball=round` = `req.query.ball`
   - the response object 
     - `(..., res)`
     -  Responsible for sending data back to the browser
     - Has methods like `send()` and `status()` that Express uses to format the output to the browser properly
       - sends headers
         - cookise
         - status code
## Express Middleware
- What does it do?
  - A series of functions that the request “goes through”
  - Each function receives request, response and next as parameters
  - Types of middleware: Application and Route
  - Application Middleware
    - Error Handling
    - Bringing in other routes
    - Applies Defaults
    - JSON, Body and Form Parsing
    - Runs on every request
  - Route Middleware
    - Dealing with specific things for a route
    - Generally, things many routes would participate in
      - Are you logged in?
      - What is your IP?
      - Have we seen you here before?
- How can we take advantage?
  - Logging
  - Dynamic Model Loading
  - Browser, Location, User specific content
  - Consistent Data Transition/Modeling/Preparation (Pre-Render)
## CRUD Operations with REST and Express
- CREATE
  - `app.post('/resource')`
- READ
  - `app.get('/resource')`
- UPDATE
  - `app.put('/resource/:id')`
- DESTROY
  - `app.get('/resource/:id')`

### Test Pyramid
- Server Testing crosses boundaries
  - Units: Server Internal Functions
    - Mock any integrations (like data fetching)
  - Integration: How it connects to other services
    - Really connect to other services (hard dependencies)
  - Acceptance
    - The server might be a dependency of some other test
