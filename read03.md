# Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

### Why would a developer choose to make data models?
- rovide very efficient "High-speed" retrieval
- Ability to handle more relationship types
- Ease of data access
- Data Integrity
- Data Independence

### What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
create/read/update/delet

### What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
- Postgres: relational database management system("relational" because the values within each table are related to each other.)
- MongoDB: NoSQL database program(non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables.)
### What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.<br />

- **database:**  is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system<br />
- **data model:**  an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.<br />
- **CRUD:**  is common in constructing web applications, because it provides a memorable framework for reminding developers of how to construct full, usable models.<br />
- **schema:** refer to a visual representation of a database, a set of rules that govern a database, or to the entire set of objects belonging to a particular user.<br />
- **sanitize:** protect the system from malicious data. <br />
- **Structured Query Language (SQL):**  a programming nomenclature used to do set operations (like union, intersect, and minus) to organize and retrieve information in relational databases, based on “set theory and relational algebra.”<br />
- **Non SQL (NoSQL):**  are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.<br />
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database program(non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables.)
- **Mongoose:** Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.<br />
- **record:**  composed of fields and contains all the data about one particular person, company, or item in a database.<br />
- **document:**  is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents. Document databases make it easier for developers to store and query data in a database by using the same document-model format they use in their application code<br />
- **Object Relation Mapping (ORM):**  a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages
