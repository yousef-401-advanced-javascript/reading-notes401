### Message Queues
1. Any connected client can “publish” a message into the server.
2. Any connected client can “subscribe” to receive messages by type.
- Queue server runs independently, and is tasked with routing events and messaging between clients.
- The Queue server has the ability to see which clients are connected, to which Queues they are attached and further, to which events they are subscribed.
- The Queue server is tasked with receiving any published message and then distributing it out to all connected and subscribed clients. It must further ensure that subscribed clients can “catch up” and pull down any messages that they might have missed during a period of disconnection with the server

### Real Time vs Queued Messaging
- messages are simply brokered by the server. They come in, are processed and are immediately broadcast out to subscribers. Should a subscriber at any point lose connection with the server, any messages broadcast by the server will clearly be missed by the client. These are known as “Real Time” messaging systems.

- A true “Queue” will keep track of the delivery status of every event/message. Any broadcast that is not received by a subscriber will remain “in the queue” until it can be delivered. In this type of systems, rather than a broadcasting of messages, clients will likely “poll” the server to retrieve any messages “in the queue” for them, on their own timeline/schedule.
