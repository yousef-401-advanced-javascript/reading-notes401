# Linked List
### Main Vocabs :
- **Linked List :** A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
- **Singly :** Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
- **Doubly :** Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
- **circular :** linked list is a little odd in that it doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value
- **Node :** Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
- **Next :** Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
- **Head :** The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
- **Current :** The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at.

#### method that can be used with Linked List:
- Traversal
- Adding (adding from beginning different from adding from middle)
- Print Out Nodes

#### Linked list is linear data structures:
which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

#### Linked list is non-linear data structures:
are node might be commected to sevral other nodes, so it can't be traversed sequentally.


### what makes arrays and linked lists different?
- the way that they use memory in our machines.
  - Array:need memory in one contiguous block to save the data.
  -  linked list: dosen't need memory in one contiguous block to save the data.
- arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures.  
  - array :needs all of its resources to be allocated when the structure is created(so when the array is grow in size and there is no enough memory you should copy the Array)
  - Linked list: It doesn’t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist, and its size and shape can change, and the amount of memory it needs can change as well.

### Parts of linked list 
 linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.<br />
 **A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.**<br />

### what even is Big O?
is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.
