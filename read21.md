### How does React Work?
- **React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory :** Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

- **React only changes what needs to be changed :** React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
