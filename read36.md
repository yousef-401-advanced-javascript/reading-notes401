# Application State with Redux

**Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.<br />
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience

### Why use Redux?
-  in larger apps with a lot of moving pieces, state management becomes a huge concern. Redux ticks that off quite well without performance concerns or trading off testability.
- Redux include logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay — all without doing so much.

### Redux principles
- **Single source of truth :**
The global state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
- **State is read-only :**
The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
- **Changes are made with pure functions :**
To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
