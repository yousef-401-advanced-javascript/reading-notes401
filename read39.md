#### Other ways to build and manage a Redux store
Redux is great, but thereâ€™s a lot of **boilerplate** code that you have write, and every developer or company will have their own internal pattern for putting it all together:

- File and Directory Names
- Reducer and Action Styles
- How do we model our data in the reducers

### Redux Toolkit
The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

- Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
- I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful
- Redux requires too much boilerplate code

#### Redux Toolkit includes these APIs
- **configureStore()**
- **createReducer()**
- **createAction()**
- **createSlice()**
- **createAsyncThunk**
- **createEntityAdapter**
